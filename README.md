# auto-completion
Program that adds to a autocompletion array if array doesn't contain something typed
download the html file
- run html file( choose a prefered browser if needed)
- start typeing a word. If word isnt in the autocompletion array then that word will get added on space press
- this program lets you put in words/strings manually in the code or it learns from what you typed.
- very simular to what web browsers do to remember what you have searched/ visited for sites. After a website is typed in if it is not already saved in your list of visited websites(i would say the function runs on enter press) it gets added then the next time u type those words or that url it would come up in blue as a autocomplete.
